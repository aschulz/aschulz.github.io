                                      <h2>Summary</h2>
                   <p class="card-text">
                       This course introduces students to the new and exciting field of computational design and fabrication, which is currently laying the foundations on which the next generation of manufacturing workflows and systems will be built. We will cover the essential computational tools of every stage in the computational fabrication pipeline: from hardware and its abstraction to the high level specification methods of design and their interactions with designers and engineers. Topics include concepts of hardware abstraction languages, geometry processing fundamentals, physics-based simulation, optimization techniques, data-driven design methods, and algorithms for high-performance interactive applications.

                       <b>Time:</b> Monday/Wednesday, 9:30-10:50am <br/>
                       <b>Location: </b> CSE2 G04. Please see Canvas for Zoom link for the first week of classes. We hope to transition to in-person lectures as soon as they are allowed.<br/>
                       <br/>
                       <b>Notes on In-Person Activities: </b> Two out of the four labs will require physical presence (fabrication) but students only need to attend 3 out of 4 labs to get 100% Lab credit (worth 10% of the final grade).  Due to current COVID concerns, the labs will only be scheduled after the first week of classes.
<br>
Students also have the option to complete an extra assignment worth 5% extra credit so students are able to get 100% credit in this course without "ever being in a room with a 3D printer", but we hope that most students will be able (and excited!) to participate in the in-person fabrication activities.

                   <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                   <p class="card-text">
                       <li>A good working knowledge of C++ programming </li>
                       <li>Basic linear algebra (matrices and vectors)</li>
                       <li>Some mathematical sophistication</li>
                       <li>No prior knowledge of manufacturing is assumed</li>
                   </p>
                   
                                   
                   
                   <h2>Policies</h2>
                   <ul>
                       <li>There will be <b>five</b> homework assignments, worth 80% of your grade.  The remaining 20% will be devoted to <i>nanoquizzes</i>.  There will be no final exam. 
                       Final project is optional and can be used to replace one assignment <i>if proposal is approved (see deadline)</i> (students can choose which assignment to drop in this case).</li>
                       <li>Labs are shown on the schedule. Most are in class and no lab will be graded. Labs are designed to expose students to commercial tools that implement some of the concepts learned in class and that the students may find useful in their future design/ fabrication work. </li> 
                       <li> Nanoquizzes will happen at the beggining of every Wednesday lecture, include 3 multi-choice questions, take 3 minutes and are done on CANVAS. 
                       They are designed to be a quick recap of the previous week and answers will be discussed after the quiz is over.
                       The <i>two</i> lowest nanoquiz scores will be dropped, therefore students should not need to retake quizzes if they miss a couple of lectures. </li>
                       <li> Assignments will be posted on CANVAS every other Friday and due by 8pm on Thursday (13 days later). The last 5 mins of the Friday lecture will be dedicated to an overview of the posted assignments.  </li>
                       <li> All assignments will be implemented in C++. Initial code and libraries will be provided. A writeup should be submitted via CANVAS for each assignment by the due date. Extra credit is possible in each assignment.</li>
                       <li> Late days are measured in periods of 24 hours and accumulate 
                       over the course of the quarter. For the first 5 late days, late assingment will lose 2% credit per day (additively). Beyond this, 
                       late assignments will lose 25% credit per day (additively).</li>
                       <li>Collaboration on homework is encouraged, but final writeups/implementations must be individual students' work. Please use the guidelines in the syllabus.</li>
